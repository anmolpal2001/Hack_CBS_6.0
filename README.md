### Idea Description
_"There are many applications that provide the solution to buy the food online 24 X 7 in India. Therefore it becomes difficult for anyone to compare the prices at different platforms for same venue. Here comes **Aahaar**, that provides the solution to compare the prices of particular venue at different platforms such as Zomato, Swiggy."_


### Novelity of the project
_1. Helps the user to find the best deal among the food tech websites._ <br>
_2. Helps the user to get the recommendation of restaurants as per the locality and budget of the user._ <br>
_3. Provides a wider reach to the cloud kitchens which are not able to work with big giants like Swiggy, Zomato etc._


### Revenue Model of Aahar
_1. Minimal charges applied for delivery from cloud kitchen to the consumer._ <br>
_2. Business for the local vendors who are not listed on websites like Swiggy, Zomato, even today._ <br>
_3. Business as per the reviews and price range to suggest/recommend the options in the particular locality._ <br>
_4. Platform for advertisement of local food businesses at affordable prices._
